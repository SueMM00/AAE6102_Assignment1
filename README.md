To convert the content of the `Assignment1_report_SUMeiling.docx` file into a GitHub README file, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Text and Figures**: First, you need to extract the text content and images from the `.docx` file.
2. **Convert to Markdown**: Transform the extracted text and figures into Markdown format.
3. **Save as README.md**: Save the converted content into a `README.md` file.

Since I cannot extract the content from the provided `.docx` file directly, I will provide a template and instructions on how to perform these steps manually.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Extract Text and Figures from `.docx`
- Open the `.docx` file using Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.
- Copy all the text content and save the images separately.

#### 2. Convert Text to Markdown
- Use a Markdown editor or an online converter to format the text.
- For headings, use `#` for main headings, `##` for sub-headings, and so on.
- For lists, use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- For code blocks, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code.

#### 3. Include Images in Markdown
- Place the images in a directory within your repository, for example, `images`.
- In your Markdown file, reference the images using the following syntax:
  ```markdown
  ![Alt text](images/image1.png)
  ```

#### 4. Save as `README.md`
- Save the file with the `.md` extension.

### Example Template
